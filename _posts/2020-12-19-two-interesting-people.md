Here are two people that appear to have lived especially interesting lives:

- 宋美齡 ([Song Meiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soong_Mei-ling)) (1897 or 1898 - 2003)

She was the wife of 蔣介石 Chaing Kai-shek and thus served as First Lady of the 中華民國 Republic of China, was the sister-in law of 孫中山 Sun Yat-sen, attended university at Wellesley College, lived through 國共內戰 the Chinese civil war 白色恐怖時期 the period of White Terror in 臺灣 Taiwan, and died in Manhattan at the age of 105.

- [Leopold Vietoris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Vietoris) (1891-2002)

I first heard about him from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in algebraic topology in the fall of 2019, and it turns out he did several interesting things.
He lived to be 110, was an alpinist, fought in WW1, was an Italisn prisoner of war, married his late wafe's sister, and of course invented several extremely useful tools in algebraic topology.
