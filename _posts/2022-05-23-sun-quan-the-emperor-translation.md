last_modified_at: 2022-05-23
---

## Introduction

I really love the Three Kingdoms, and I have two goals for this post. 
1. Write a translation that is better than the other ones out there. This translation isn't good, but it still sounds better than the others in my opinion.
2. Explain or link to the relevant background information to understand the song. 

If you can read Chinese, please read the Chinese versions of the provided Wikipedia articles.
They usually have significantly more information!

It's worth looking at a [map](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%9B%BD#/media/File:%E4%B8%89%E5%9B%BD%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%8C%BA%E5%88%92(%E7%B9%81).png) of the three kingdoms around this time to see just how far Wu extended to the south.

In the [Battle of Xiaoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Xiaoting)（猇亭之戰）, Lu Xun lit bundles of straw on file to attack the Shu camps. This battle ended the Shu advance.

[^27]: According to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Sun Quan chopped off the corner of a writing desk with a saber upon deciding to unite with Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang in fighting Cao Cao on the eve of the Battle of Red Cliff. 權拔佩劍砍面前奏案一角曰：「諸官將有再言降操者，與此案同！」

[to sieze][Jing province] [to resist][Liu Bei] [to join][Cao Cao] [together][to subdue][Xiangfan]\

[^44]: Sun Wu under the last emperor [Sun Hao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Hao)（孫皓）was lost to the Western Jin（[西晉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A5%BF%E6%99%8B)） dynasty in 280 CE.  

[光][陰][逝] [千][載][過] [功成者] [都][付笑談間]\

## Future Work

I know of three other knockoff songs, 操戈天下、備量天下 and 瑜弈天下, and all of them could use translations!

## Sources

- For this translation, I mimicked the style of East Asia Student's blog [here](https://eastasiastudent.net/dunhuang-zui-hou-shi-li-xie-shu-drunk-apology-letter-translation/)
- I referenced another translation in the comments [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJms1CGHjn8)
- The first comment on [this](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30382413) link explains the historical parts of the song. I translated some of it and added it to the footnotes.
